## GitEvents - Event Management meets Issue Ops

**Organizing events is hard!** Scheduling, venues, speakers, attendees,
sponsors, there are a lot things to keep track of. With GitEvents we're trying
to make the life for organizers a little bit easier, by taking care of managing
talk proposals and event scheduling. GitEvents automates several processes such
as broadcasting to various channels such as Twitter, Discord, etc. Finally, you
can use the GitHub API and the set of pre-defined labels to retrieve all the
events and talks for a beautiful event website.
