## GitEvents - Event Management meets Issue Ops

**Organizing events is hard!** Scheduling, venues, speakers, attendees,
sponsors, there are a lot things to keep track of. With GitEvents we're trying
to make the life for organizers a little bit easier, by taking care of managing
talk proposals and event scheduling. GitEvents automates several processes such
as broadcasting to various channels such as Twitter, Discord, etc. Finally, you
can use the GitHub API and the set of pre-defined labels to retrieve all the
events and talks for a beautiful event website.

- 🌈 Open & Inclusive Organization
- :octocat: Manage Events, Talks, Suggestions etc. with GitHub Issues
- 🧑‍💻 GitHub GraphQL backend to feed your own website
- 🤖 Automation with GitHub Actions
- 🙈 No databases, admin management, etc.

## How it works

We recommend to use a GitHub Organization for your group, such as the
[Cyprus Developer Community](http://github.com/cyprus-developer-community),
[BarcelonaJS](https://github.com/barcelonajs) etc. You can then add GitEvents to
any repo ie. `events` by adding the
[GitEvents Action](https://github.com/gitevents/action). There are more GitHub
Actions for different purposes, for example a Calendar Action to generate `.ics`
files for calendar subscriptions or the Broadcast Action to tweet about your
events. We have a [GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/gitevents/projects/1)
with feature requests and things we're working on to make GitEvents even better.
All contributions are welcome.
